                                    <p>Warangal Fort, in the present-day Indian state of Telangana, appears to have existed since at least the 13th century CE. Although precise dating of its construction and subsequent enhancements are uncertain, historians and archaeologists generally accept that an earlier brick-walled structure was replaced with stone by Ganapatideva, who died in 1262, and that his successors – Rudramadevi and Prataparudra II – added to its height and added gateways, square bastions and additional circular earthern walls prior to the latter's death in 1323.</p>
